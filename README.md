# World's Most Annoying Cookie Consent ðŸ˜„
This project is part of the Essential Javascript Concept Module from Scrimba's `The Frontend Career Path Course`. It is an annoying cookie consent project that forces the user to accept the site cookies. When the user attempts to decline the cookies, the decline button is swapped to the accept button, hence making it impossible for the user to decline the cookies. LOL 

## Concepts Learned

    - setTimeout Method: to control when the modal popup appears
    - element.style: to dynamically update an element's css property
    - forms: used HTML form element with the input type of text and email 
    - formData & get Method: to get the form data as an object and access the name value, display it in the app
    - event.preventDefault: to get more control over how the form is submitted
    - CSS: row-reverse: to prevent the users from clicking the decline button
    - classList.toggle(): to dynamically add and remove the class that set the row-reverse property to motion
    - 'disabled' attribute: to disable the button that closes the modal until the last message appears
